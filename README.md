# mle-task-face-augmented-reality
This project combines a Python script that generates textured 3D models from images using Shap-E, and a web AR interface that overlays a 3D hat onto a user's face in real-time. The web app uses face tracking to position and allow manual adjustment of the hat, creating an interactive augmented reality experience
